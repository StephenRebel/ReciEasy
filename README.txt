ReciEasy 1.0

This is the final project I created for COMP2406. It is a simple webapp that allows users to request recipes based on a keyword from an API, adn then allows a user to save the relevant information to their personal cookbook to view later if they wish. 

The app uses the node.js framework as its main language, and uses handle bars as its templating engine.
It also uses a variety of node packages as outlined in the package.json file. Some of which are the express framework for server design, express session to verify our users etc.

The project is complete in a basic state as of now and has the majority of the functionality I had intended, however it remains a good code base that could be expanded upon in the future to include more features. The code is also at a base level and could be refined much further but in the process of learning I kept changing and learning new ways the code could be written better, and such changes could be made in future versions.
